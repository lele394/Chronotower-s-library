# Notes from the gremlin

So this is selfhosted, https doesn't work for some reason sadly, i'll look into that later as i'm taking a look at the whole server architecture atm.

Might go down, that's to be expected tho, ping @lele394 on the discord in that case. I can put it back up.

This is **HIGHLY** experimental. Tho the site's skeleton is mostly alright, data needs to be reviewed and verified. If you notice anything, please reach out to me @lele394.

Roadmap is available below. Site might not be up to date with it as updates are not automatic.
