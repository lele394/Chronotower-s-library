      "She was an orphan brought up in the Belgica Convent. When she was a child, she was often bullied by others, including the mother superior of the Convent, and could only shed tears alone in a hidden corner. No one was willing to step forward to help her.\n\nThe convent belfry often sent strange sounds into the night, which was feared to be haunted. Therefore, the daily duty of ringing the belfry's bell was assigned to her. \n\nNight by night, she climbs to the top with her lamp to ring the bell alone.",
      "However, people gradually realize that this young girl was no longer the child sobbing in the corner. \n\nAn unholy aura surrounds her so that no one dares to approach. People start spreading rumors that this young girl may have made a pact with the demon in the belfry.",
      "Actually she did but she is not fully obedient to the demon. \n\nShe uses the demon's power stored in the lamp to heal the pain, rather than hurting others.",
      "It turns out that her crying alone at night on the top of the belfry awakened the demon that was sleeping in the darkness. \n\nThe demon reaches out to her and offers its power, the genuineness of which makes her feel warm and secure. \n\nThough she receives the power, she still possesses her self-awareness, not always following the demon's order. \n\nThus the demon inflicts physical misery on her as a punishment, which makes her skin paler, bit by bit. \n\nTo hide her morbid body, she wraps thick bandages around her legs."

      "Besides her sister, Yothaya is the only friend that Miku can have fun with carefreely.\n\nBoth of them are fond of cooking and often enter the forest to search for all kinds of ingredients.\nThe apples on the tree, the mushrooms in a haystack, everything can be the inspiration to their new dishes.\n\nSince Yothaya is still learning to cook, she often creates some strange dishes that are hard to swallow. However, as her friend, Miku always eats up all of them by pinching her nose."

      "People are indulged in her beautiful songs, accompanied by the beautiful melody from her harp. Perhaps this is the so-called heavenly sound. \n\nIt is said that she often learns new tunes from Mayahuel, who guards the Forest of Elves. \n\nAs a High Elf, Mayahuel should only know elven music; however, Flora keeps playing new tunes that celebrate the happy life of humans. It can therefore be assumed that she must have other ways of learning new songs.",

The two often play by the lake. \n\nSometimes Flora even wades into the water to help Caledonia groom her Sacred Beast. This is a rare moment when Flora wears a smile.",
      "It is said that she inherited the noblest elven bloodline, and even Mayahuel, who guards the Forest of Elves, uses honorific titles with her. \n\nSome people speculate that she is the daughter of Dana, Goddess of the Lake, but no one dares to mention this kind of topic in front of the High Elves. \n\nThe topic about Flora's father is even considered taboo by Mayahuel, and once mentioned, Mayahuel's mood will sour into aggression, making those around her tremble."

      "Having heard that people are heading to the Tower in search of the Dark Magic, the Church sent Anemone to cleanse those greedy ones. \n\nYet her immense power is also a potential risk for the Church so the Preacher Fellagood is appointed to go with her into the Tower and keep a close watch on her along the way. \n\nAnemone never holds back her dislike to anything she finds annoying so she always has a fight with Dejase who is too reticent for her to get along with. Yet the fight itself is harmless, nothing more than thoughtless bickering.\n\nAnemone has strong self-esteem.

The girl finally lost control of her psychic power. \n\nThe uncontrolled raw power ruined the whole village where all the villagers with their minds corrupted, gradually died in agony.",

As her body was getting weak, she thought she didn't have much time left, but after a farewell to the past, maybe a new life could be led. \n\nWith that thought in mind, the girl took a step toward her uncertain future.",

She met a Miko from her homeland who is traveling around the Chilora continent and the Miko suggested that she should set a goal of pursuing the meaning of life and with a goal, the hope would finally be restored.\n\n\nShe felt inspired by the Miko's words and decided to embark on a journey with the Miko. \n\nHer life may come to an end at any time but before that, she just wants to use her tiny power to help others. This may be the meaning of life."

      "Lately under the influence of Miku, she has become more concerned with her appearance. \n\nPreviously, she had never thought of changing her appearance because her body stays unchanged and there is no need for her to dress up for others. \n\nShe has considered asking others how to dress up but as the head of the Six Ovates, she finds it hard to drop her pride, which has bothered her so much that she even couldn't set her mind on presiding over the sacrifice. \n\nShe sneaked out from the ritual and hid in a corner alone with hands covering her blushing face. \n\nThis girlish behavior was seen by Yui and recorded in her little book quietly for an unknown purpose."

However, all males are forbidden to enter the forest. \n\nSomeone witnessed that she attacked Garditis who tried to trespass on the forest and even disregarded her identity of High Elf to severely scold Garditis.",
      "She takes great care of Flora, and often teaches Flora new tunes although she is not good at composing music herself. \n\nAccording to Mineer's proof, it seems that someone comes to the Forest of Elves regularly to pass on new songs to Mayahuel.",
      "Mayahuel liked a human male before but unexpectedly the one she revered most also liked this man, so she chose to quit and wish them happiness. \n\nYet this relationship didn't last long as the human male deserted his lover and left the forest. \n\nMayahuel was there to witness all so she started to hate all males and pledged that no male would be allowed to set food on Forest of Elves."

He delivers the latest news of the outside to her, including some new songs. \n\nMayahuel knows nothing about this and even teaches the songs to Flora. \n\nMineer's elegant manners often lead to an illusion that she has good taste in music, but actually, she is a poor learner in music. \n\nEach time she offers the new song to Mayahuel, she has to clumsily avoid Mayahuel's questions, with an entirely different face from usual. \n\nLuckily Mayahuel is not very suspicious but just curious why Mineer can always discover such great pieces of music."

      "After Matveiffe's disappearance, people guessed at where she had gone; lost in the wildnerness on a stargazing trip gone awry, or eloped with some peasant boy in the country. They soon put the strange stargazing girl out of their minds.\nSeveral years later, Matveiffe's return sent shockwaves through Muntenia. She was, however, no longer the same stargazing girl they once knew. Her cold gaze belied her perception of the frequencies that bound all things, and her manipulation of those same frequencies to warp, crush and otherwise destroy everything she laid eyes on.",
      "The Muntenian leadership quickly found Matveiffe. They had been desperate to find anything or anyone that could stand up to the monster of Pannonia—the Annihilator of Existence. And in Matveiffe, they found their answer.\n\"The mind is prone to deviate. All I do is correct it, while creating new deviations.\""

Worse, monsters began flying up from the ground to invade the forest. $B$$B$The downfall of the Forest of Elves seemed inevitable...",

But still, she set aside her misgivings and joined the team—she would get on the Dazzling Stage and become an idol. $B$$B$She trained hard every day toward that end. But things didn't go as smoothly as she had hoped. Difficulties abounded. A gloomy future awaited Forest of Elves..."

      "Snowshine is the child of a human and an elf. Because of the human blood in her body, she was ostracized in the Forest of Elves.",
      "Snowshine likes to use her power to make delicious desserts since she was a child. When she grew up, she opened a dessert store in a human town, which was widely loved by local residents, and even some gourmets went long distances to have a taste.",
      "The elves considered Snowbirds, who were integrated into human society, to be an alien. However, because the elves themselves live far from human society, Snowshine did not suffer from their harassment.",
      "Recently, she has developed new desserts to prepare for the upcoming hot sale in anticipation of the human holiday."
