No one was willing to step forward to help her.\n\nThe convent belfry often sent strange sounds into the night, which was feared to be haunted. Therefore, the daily duty of ringing the belfry's bell was assigned to her. \n\nNight by night, she climbs to the top with her lamp to ring the bell alone.",
      "However, people gradually realize that this young girl was no longer the child sobbing in the corner. \n\nAn unholy aura surrounds her so that no one dares to approach. People start spreading rumors that this young girl may have made a pact with the demon in the belfry.",
      "Actually she did but she is not fully obedient to the demon. \n\nShe uses the demon's power stored in the lamp to heal the pain, rather than hurting others.",
      "It turns out that her crying alone at night on the top of the belfry awakened the demon that was sleeping in the darkness. \n\nThe demon reaches out to her and offers its power, the genuineness of which makes her feel warm and secure. \n\nThough she receives the power, she still possesses her self-awareness, not always following the demon's order. \n\nThus the demon inflicts physical misery on her as a punishment, which makes her skin paler, bit by bit. \n\nTo hide her morbid body, she wraps thick bandages around her legs."

      "Besides her sister, Yothaya is the only friend that Miku can have fun with carefreely.\n\nBoth of them are fond of cooking and often enter the forest to search for all kinds of ingredients.\nThe apples on the tree, the mushrooms in a haystack, everything can be the inspiration to their new dishes.\n\nSince Yothaya is still learning to cook, she often creates some strange dishes that are hard to swallow. However, as her friend, Miku always eats up all of them by pinching her nose."

No one knows exactly where she came from. \n\nSome say she came from the Forest of Elves, and may even be one of the legendary elves. She seems scared of connecting with humans though. \n\nEven in stormy weather, she also appears at the fountain on time. The sky clears again as her song ends. \n\nWhen people are still stunned by such a miracle, she has quietly departed, leaving behind a wanting for more...",
      "People are indulged in her beautiful songs, accompanied by the beautiful melody from her harp. Perhaps this is the so-called heavenly sound. \n\nIt is said that she often learns new tunes from Mayahuel, who guards the Forest of Elves. \n\nAs a High Elf, Mayahuel should only know elven music; however, Flora keeps playing new tunes that celebrate the happy life of humans. It can therefore be assumed that she must have other ways of learning new songs.",
      "Flora is guarded by Mayahuel and served by Mineer, both of whom are not technically her friends. \n\nHer only friend is Caledonia. The two often play by the lake. \n\nSometimes Flora even wades into the water to help Caledonia groom her Sacred Beast. This is a rare moment when Flora wears a smile.",
      "It is said that she inherited the noblest elven bloodline, and even Mayahuel, who guards the Forest of Elves, uses honorific titles with her. \n\nSome people speculate that she is the daughter of Dana, Goddess of the Lake, but no one dares to mention this kind of topic in front of the High Elves. \n\nThe topic about Flora's father is even considered taboo by Mayahuel, and once mentioned, Mayahuel's mood will sour into aggression, making those around her tremble."

The two of them often stroll by the lake together, showing an intimate friendship that no one can get involved in.",

He was too proud to get close to humans, let alone be manipulated by them. \n\nHowever, the Sacred Beast before Caledonia is totally different. He seems very close to the human Caledonia and even allows her to touch his unicorn, a symbol of his nobility. \n\nUnder the full moon, Caledonia likes to stroke the plush fur of the Sacred Beast by the lake and quietly snuggle up to him. \n\nSometimes she helps the Beast clean, comb and dry his hair, carefully and patiently.",
      "Caledonia used to be not mindful of her appearance but since she was seen in gorgeous garments and complimented by Flora, she has started to pay heed to her dressing and even tries on the noble garments she rejected before. \n\nThe Sacred Beast has noticed her changes and disapproves of her behavior. \n\nEach time Caledonia is dressed up in finery, the Beast will shake his body by fits, trying to toss off Caledonia to show his discontent."

One day she was possessed by the metempsychosis of a priestess and endowed with the power of nature that allowed her to cast all kinds of elemental spells. \n\nYet this power was so strong that she was ostracized and feared by others. \n\nAll those negative emotions had far exceeded what a maiden of her age could bear. \n\nAs more fears crept in, she decided to leave her homeland, away from those who hurt her before.",

      "Having heard that people are heading to the Tower in search of the Dark Magic, the Church sent Anemone to cleanse those greedy ones. \n\nYet her immense power is also a potential risk for the Church so the Preacher Fellagood is appointed to go with her into the Tower and keep a close watch on her along the way. \n\nAnemone never holds back her dislike to anything she finds annoying so she always has a fight with Dejase who is too reticent for her to get along with. Yet the fight itself is harmless, nothing more than thoughtless bickering.\n\nAnemone has strong self-esteem. Once hurt, she will vent her feelings waywardly, which is a major headache for Fellagood."

Only when she is very angry will she change back to the appearance of a dragon.",

      "As a dragon, Ella has survived for thousands of years but she hates people mentioning her age. \n\nPerhaps she has grown accustomed to human society and its vanities regarding age.",
      "She used to live a secluded life with her clan. \n\nWhen she told her parents that she wanted to leave the Dragon's Lair to the outside world, her parents were in a rage.\n\n\"The outside is dangerous and humans are malicious. They have done anything to catch all ancient clans including us. We will never approve of your leaving.\"\n\nDespite her parents' repeated warnings, Ella still entered the human world out of curiosity.\n\nThe bustling streets and the flow of people both made her excited. \n\nShe hid her dragon form and changed into a human girl, running to the brand-new world with glee."

The girl finally lost control of her psychic power. \n\nThe uncontrolled raw power ruined the whole village where all the villagers with their minds corrupted, gradually died in agony.",

As her body was getting weak, she thought she didn't have much time left, but after a farewell to the past, maybe a new life could be led. \n\nWith that thought in mind, the girl took a step toward her uncertain future.",
      "After leaving Sunrise Island, Tama felt even weaker and only a little move could bring her discomfort. \n\nThus instead of going out, she preferred to stay home, which resulted in her skin being paler. \n\nA rotten life like this didn't last long. She met a Miko from her homeland who is traveling around the Chilora continent and the Miko suggested that she should set a goal of pursuing the meaning of life and with a goal, the hope would finally be restored.\n\n\nShe felt inspired by the Miko's words and decided to embark on a journey with the Miko. \n\nHer life may come to an end at any time but before that, she just wants to use her tiny power to help others. This may be the meaning of life."

They soon put the strange stargazing girl out of their minds.\nSeveral years later, Matveiffe's return sent shockwaves through Muntenia. She was, however, no longer the same stargazing girl they once knew. Her cold gaze belied her perception of the frequencies that bound all things, and her manipulation of those same frequencies to warp, crush and otherwise destroy everything she laid eyes on.",

And in Matveiffe, they found their answer.\n\"The mind is prone to deviate. All I do is correct it, while creating new deviations.\""

She explained that she had no ill intent and that she was only attracted there by the smell of food. After a brief talk with the girl, the magistrate realized she was just an innocent girl clueless about how human society works.$B$$B$So instead of punishing her, he invited her to his home.

Excited, she had forgotten her parents' words of caution and was ready to plunge herself into an unknown world."

That's good. Let's make this place your burial ground, shall we?\""
